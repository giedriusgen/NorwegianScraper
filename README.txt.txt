I have created program which collects information about the flights from www.norwegian.com.

I am collecting that information: departure airport, arrival airport, departure time, arrival time, cheapest price and taxes.

In my example I am collecting information about direct flights from OSL (Oslo) to RIX (Riga) departing from 2019-04-01 to 2019-04-30 (30 departure days).
